## About

The report template on Microsoft Power BI Desktop use specifics iTop queries phrasebooks to display the helpdesk activity of your service.
The queries phrasebooks are provided into [combodo-power-integration](https://github.com/Combodo/combodo-powerbi-integration).

For more information about this module have a look at the [Documentation](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=extensions:combodo-powerbi-integration).

## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a
running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
additional modules.
